# BRKR - Dog Dating For Super Smart Dogs

BRKR is a always online multiplayer dog breeding/simulation game where players breed dogs for intelligence over millions of game years that take place during each of the game's seasons, in an attempt to create a space-faring civilization of dogs.

Dogs are unique because humans "made them out of wolves", and they do not *currently* select their own mates.

The player goal of BRKR is to help advance the online dog civ to it's highest levels without going bankrupt. Each player manages their own population of dogs, and they're bound by their own domestic infrastructure to educate, feed, and house these dogs. Dogs that are bred for intelligence require expensive high-protein diets to feed their massive brains, and due to their large litter sizes, the player will need to find support roles and jobs for their dogs of lower intelligence who are not good breeding stock.

The dog sim is infinitely deep and every dog is a procedural entity. Dogs are highly parameterized and the entire genetics system is modeled and passed on to their offspring.

The game is orchestrated to take place over a season. At the start of the season all player and world progress is reset. Each season lasts about 3 real world months and takes place over millions of game years.

Players negotiate trades and dates with other online players with the goal of getting their lady dogs pregnant. When a dog is pregnant, the litter will be randomly divided between the two owners of the dogs' parents.

As the civilization progresses and dogs become more intelligent, it will take more effort for the human minders to entice their dogs to date and breed. Dogs will develop their own cultures, work and life habits, and their own desires in a breeding partner. 

Because players will have to make personal sacrifices for the shared goal of making space dogs, players are essentially all co-tending this dog civilization as an always online dog-gardening game.

Early on, the dogs will progress from an Antiquity-equivalent era to a New Scientific Rennaisance period where they'll update their theological beliefs to understand that their dating choices are bent towards an empirically observable outcome for selecting for a specific trait. They'll posit the theory that there's not 10 gods (like they thought), there's not even 1 god, there's simply an outside observer that is biasing their choices to arrive at higher probability of specific outcomes. In a later act, they will create a grand unifying theory, which if true, would enable communication with beings on greater levels. Eventually, the theory is proven and implemented. The player plays as the AI of the dating app, and eventually the Dogs make First Contact.
