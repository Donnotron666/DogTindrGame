# DogTindrForSuperSmartDogs

DogTindrForSuperSmartDogs is a always online multiplayer dog breeding/simulation game where players breed dogs for intelligence over millions of game years that take place during the game's season, in an attempt to create a space-faring civilization of dogs.

Dogs are unique because humans "made them out of wolves", and they do not *currently* select their own mates.

The player goal of DTFSSD is to help advance the online dog civ to it's highest levels without going bankrupt. Each player manages their own population of dogs, and they're bound by their infrastructure to educate, feed, and house these dogs. Dogs that are bred for intelligence require expensive high-protein diets to feed their massive brains, and due to their large litter sizes, the player will need to find support roles and jobs for their dogs of lower intelligence who are not good breeding stock.

The game is orchestrated to take place over a season. At the start of the season all player and world progress is reset. Each season lasts about 3 real world months and takes place over millions of game years.

Players negotiate trades and dates with other online players with the goal of getting their lady dogs pregnant. When a dog is pregnant, the litter will be randomly divided between the two owners of the dogs' parents.

As the civilization progresses and dogs become more intelligent, it will take more effort for the human minders to entice their dogs to date and breed. Dogs will develop their own cultures, work and life habits, and their own desires in a breeding partner.
